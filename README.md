# CSIS110 Fall 2025
Starter Code For CSIS110 HW3

Develop a function, makeID, that accepts a user’s first name and last name separately (each is stored in its own variable), and returns (not prints) a string in all upper case composed of the first letter of the user’s first name, followed by the first five characters of the user’s last name, followed by a random 2 digit number in the range of 10 to 99.  Assume that the last name provided is at least five letters long. Create a second function, called main, that prompts the user for their first name, then prompts the user for their last name, calls makeID and then prints the returned string

For example, if firstName contained “Ira”, and lastName contained “Goldstein”: 
makeID(firstName, lastName) would return the text similar to     IGOLDS42
